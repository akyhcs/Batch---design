Yes, you can use a Decider in Spring Batch to check if a step has failed after retry attempts and control the flow of the job accordingly. A Decider is a custom implementation of the JobExecutionDecider interface, allowing you to evaluate the status of previous steps and decide the next action (e.g., terminate the job, retry, or proceed to another step).

Here’s how you can implement a Decider for this scenario:

Steps to Implement Decider for Step Failure Handling

1. Create a Custom Decider:

Implement the JobExecutionDecider interface.

Use the decide method to evaluate the status of the step (e.g., FAILED after retries).



2. Add the Decider to the Job Flow:

Use .next(decider) to invoke the Decider after the step.

Control the flow based on the Decider’s outcome.

Code Example

1. Custom Decider

This Decider checks if the previous step has failed after retry attempts and returns a decision (PROCEED, STOP, etc.).

@Component
public class RetryCheckDecider implements JobExecutionDecider {

    @Override
    public FlowExecutionStatus decide(JobExecution jobExecution, StepExecution stepExecution) {
        // Get the status of the previous step
        BatchStatus stepStatus = stepExecution.getStatus();

        if (stepStatus == BatchStatus.FAILED) {
            System.out.println("Step has failed after retries. Deciding to STOP the job.");
            return new FlowExecutionStatus("STOP");
        }

        System.out.println("Step completed successfully. Proceeding to the next step.");
        return new FlowExecutionStatus("PROCEED");
    }
}

2. Job Configuration

In the job configuration, use the Decider to evaluate the step's status and control the flow.

@Bean
public Job job(Step step1, Step step2, RetryCheckDecider retryCheckDecider) {
    return jobBuilderFactory.get("jobWithRetryCheck")
            .start(step1)
            .next(retryCheckDecider) // Add Decider after Step 1
            .from(retryCheckDecider).on("PROCEED").to(step2) // If Step 1 is successful, proceed to Step 2
            .from(retryCheckDecider).on("STOP").end() // If Step 1 fails, stop the job
            .build();
}


---

3. Step Configuration

Configure Step 1 with retries using .faultTolerant().

@Bean
public Step step1(Tasklet step1Tasklet) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
            .tasklet(step1Tasklet)
            .faultTolerant()
            .retry(Exception.class) // Retry on exceptions
            .retryLimit(3) // Retry up to 3 times
            .build();
}

@Bean
public Step step2(Tasklet step2Tasklet) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("step2")
            .tasklet(step2Tasklet)
            .build();
}

Flow Explanation

1. Step 1 Execution:

Executes Step 1 with a retry policy.

If Step 1 fails after retries, its status is marked as FAILED.



2. Decider Execution:

The Decider checks the status of Step 1 using the StepExecution object.

If Step 1 is FAILED, it returns "STOP".

If Step 1 is COMPLETED, it returns "PROCEED".



3. Job Flow Control:

Based on the Decider’s output:

"PROCEED": Executes Step 2.

"STOP": Ends the job.

Advantages of Using a Decider

1. Dynamic Flow Control:

Adjust the job flow based on the status of previous steps.



2. Granular Failure Handling:

Stop the job or take alternative actions when steps fail after retries.



3. Reusability:

The Decider can be reused across different jobs for similar logic.

Logs Example

1. If Step 1 completes successfully:

Step completed successfully. Proceeding to the next step.


2. If Step 1 fails after retries:

Step has failed after retries. Deciding to STOP the job.

This implementation allows the job to decide dynamically based on the retry results, making it flexible and robust. Let me know if you need further assistance!
