Handling Long-Running Jobs in Spring Batch

To detect and handle jobs that are running longer than expected, we need a monitoring and alerting system.


---

1. Solution Approach

To track long-running jobs, we will: âœ… Define an "expected duration" for each job.
âœ… Monitor job execution times using the JobExplorer API in Spring Batch.
âœ… Trigger alerts (Slack, Email, or Logs) if a job exceeds its expected time.
âœ… Optionally, terminate or restart long-running jobs if necessary.

2. Define an Expected Job Duration

For each job, we can define a maximum allowed execution time (e.g., 10 minutes).

Add an Expected Duration Configuration

batch:
  job:
    maxExecutionTimeInMinutes: 10  # Define expected duration for jobs

âœ” This value will be used for monitoring.


---

3. Implement Monitoring with JobExplorer

Spring Batch provides the JobExplorer API to query running jobs.
We will create a scheduled task that:

1. Checks active jobs.


2. Calculates their running time.


3. Logs a warning if a job exceeds the expected time.


4. Optionally, sends an alert (Slack, Email, etc.).



Job Monitoring Service

import org.springframework.batch.core.BatchStatus;
import org.springframework.batch.core.explore.JobExplorer;
import org.springframework.batch.core.JobExecution;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.util.List;

@Service
public class JobMonitoringService {

    private final JobExplorer jobExplorer;
    private final long maxExecutionTimeInMinutes = 10; // Define expected duration

    public JobMonitoringService(JobExplorer jobExplorer) {
        this.jobExplorer = jobExplorer;
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 300000) // Run every 5 minutes
    public void checkLongRunningJobs() {
        List<JobExecution> runningJobs = jobExplorer.findRunningJobExecutions("batchJob");

        for (JobExecution jobExecution : runningJobs) {
            LocalDateTime startTime = jobExecution.getStartTime().toLocalDateTime();
            Duration duration = Duration.between(startTime, LocalDateTime.now());

            if (duration.toMinutes() > maxExecutionTimeInMinutes) {
                System.err.println("WARNING: Job " + jobExecution.getJobId() +
                        " has been running for " + duration.toMinutes() + " minutes. Expected: " + maxExecutionTimeInMinutes);
                
                // Optionally send an alert
                sendAlert(jobExecution, duration);
            }
        }
    }

    private void sendAlert(JobExecution jobExecution, Duration duration) {
        // Integrate with Slack, Email, or Logging
        System.out.println("ALERT: Job " + jobExecution.getJobId() + " is taking too long!");
    }
}

âœ” Runs every 5 minutes and checks for long-running jobs.
âœ” Logs a warning and triggers an alert if a job exceeds the expected time.

4. Optionally: Stop or Restart Stuck Jobs

If a job runs too long, we can:

Stop the job manually.

Automatically terminate and restart it.


Stop a Long-Running Job

import org.springframework.batch.core.repository.JobRepository;
import org.springframework.batch.core.explore.JobExplorer;
import org.springframework.batch.core.BatchStatus;
import org.springframework.batch.core.JobExecution;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;
import java.util.List;

@Service
public class JobTerminatorService {

    private final JobExplorer jobExplorer;
    private final JobRepository jobRepository;
    private final long maxExecutionTimeInMinutes = 10;

    public JobTerminatorService(JobExplorer jobExplorer, JobRepository jobRepository) {
        this.jobExplorer = jobExplorer;
        this.jobRepository = jobRepository;
    }

    @Transactional
    public void stopLongRunningJobs() {
        List<JobExecution> runningJobs = jobExplorer.findRunningJobExecutions("batchJob");

        for (JobExecution jobExecution : runningJobs) {
            if (jobExecution.getStatus() == BatchStatus.STARTED) {
                long duration = Duration.between(jobExecution.getStartTime().toLocalDateTime(), LocalDateTime.now()).toMinutes();

                if (duration > maxExecutionTimeInMinutes) {
                    System.err.println("Stopping job " + jobExecution.getJobId() + " due to excessive runtime.");
                    jobExecution.setStatus(BatchStatus.STOPPED);
                    jobRepository.update(jobExecution);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

âœ” Detects stuck jobs and stops them automatically.
