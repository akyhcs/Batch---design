The JobLauncher in Spring Batch is a component responsible for launching jobs. It is used to start a job by passing the job instance and
associated parameters. The JobLauncher provides the entry point for triggering batch jobs programmatically.

JobLauncher Basics

1. Interface:

The JobLauncher interface provides the run() method to start a job.


JobExecution run(Job job, JobParameters jobParameters) throws JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException,
        JobRestartException, JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException, JobParametersInvalidException;


2. Responsibilities:

Start a new job instance or restart a failed job.

Accept JobParameters to uniquely identify and manage job instances.

Using JobLauncher

1. Injecting JobLauncher

Spring Batch provides a default JobLauncher bean that can be autowired into your application.

@Autowired
private JobLauncher jobLauncher;

@Autowired
private Job job;


---

2. Launching a Job

Example Code:

public void launchJob() {
    JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParametersBuilder()
            .addString("timestamp", String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis())) // Unique parameter
            .toJobParameters();

    try {
        JobExecution jobExecution = jobLauncher.run(job, jobParameters);
        System.out.println("Job Status: " + jobExecution.getStatus());
    } catch (JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException | JobRestartException |
             JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException | JobParametersInvalidException e) {
        System.err.println("Job failed to start: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}

Explanation:

1. Create JobParameters to uniquely identify the job instance.


2. Call the run() method of JobLauncher to start the job.


3. Handle exceptions for scenarios like:

The job is already running (JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException).

The job cannot be restarted (JobRestartException).

The job instance is already complete (JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException).

Invalid parameters (JobParametersInvalidException).

3. Triggering a Job from a REST API

You can trigger a Spring Batch job using a REST API endpoint.

Controller Example:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/batch")
public class JobController {

    @Autowired
    private JobLauncher jobLauncher;

    @Autowired
    private Job job;

    @PostMapping("/start")
    public ResponseEntity<String> startJob(@RequestParam String parameter) {
        JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParametersBuilder()
                .addString("param", parameter)
                .addLong("timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis()) // Unique parameter
                .toJobParameters();

        try {
            JobExecution jobExecution = jobLauncher.run(job, jobParameters);
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Job started successfully with status: " + jobExecution.getStatus());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Job failed to start: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. Expose an API endpoint (/batch/start) to start the job.


2. Pass job parameters (e.g., from query parameters) to make the job unique.


3. Use JobLauncher.run() to start the job and return the status.

Customizing the JobLauncher

You can customize the JobLauncher by providing your own bean definition.

Example of a Custom JobLauncher:

@Bean
public JobLauncher customJobLauncher(JobRepository jobRepository) {
    SimpleJobLauncher jobLauncher = new SimpleJobLauncher();
    jobLauncher.setJobRepository(jobRepository); // Link JobRepository
    jobLauncher.setTaskExecutor(new SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor()); // Async Execution
    return jobLauncher;
}

Features:

1. Async Execution:

Use SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor to execute jobs asynchronously.



2. Custom JobRepository:

Attach a custom JobRepository for advanced job management.





---

JobLauncher Exceptions

1. JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException:

Thrown if you try to start a job that is already running.



2. JobRestartException:

Thrown if a job cannot be restarted due to invalid state or configuration.



3. JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException:

Thrown if the job instance is already complete and cannot be restarted.



4. JobParametersInvalidException:

Thrown if the job parameters are invalid.





---

Best Practices

1. Unique Job Parameters:

Always use unique job parameters to create a new job instance (e.g., add a timestamp).



2. Monitoring:

Use Spring Batch metadata tables (BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION) to track job executions.



3. Asynchronous Execution:

Use an asynchronous JobLauncher if jobs are time-consuming and shouldn't block the main thread.





---

Summary

The JobLauncher is the entry point for programmatically triggering jobs in Spring Batch.

Use run() to start jobs with unique parameters.

Customize the JobLauncher for advanced scenarios like asynchronous execution.
