If you're not looking to use RetryTemplate, but still want to use Spring Retry for retrying operations without explicitly using the template, you can achieve it by leveraging the @Retryable annotation provided by Spring Retry.

Here's how you can do that:

1. Add Spring Retry Dependency

Make sure the Spring Retry dependency is added to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.retry</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-retry</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.1</version>
</dependency>

2. Enable Spring Retry in Your Application

In your main Spring Boot application or a configuration class, enable retry functionality by adding the @EnableRetry annotation:

import org.springframework.retry.annotation.EnableRetry;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableRetry
public class RetryApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(RetryApplication.class, args);
    }
}

3. Use @Retryable Annotation

You can apply the @Retryable annotation to any method that you want to retry in case of failure.

Example of a Service with Retryable Method:

import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Recover;
import org.springframework.retry.annotation.Retryable;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    // Retryable method - retries on any RuntimeException
    @Retryable(value = RuntimeException.class, maxAttempts = 3, backoff = @Backoff(delay = 1000, multiplier = 2))
    public String performNetworkCall() {
        // Simulate a network call with a random chance of failure
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {  // 50% chance of failure
            System.out.println("Simulating failure...");
            throw new RuntimeException("Network error");
        }
        System.out.println("Network call succeeded.");
        return "Success";
    }

    // Fallback method - executed when retries are exhausted
    @Recover
    public String recover(RuntimeException e) {
        System.out.println("Retries exhausted. Recovering...");
        return "Failed after retries";
    }
}

Explanation:

@Retryable:

value: Specifies the exception type to trigger retries. In this case, we're retrying for RuntimeException.

maxAttempts: The number of retry attempts, including the initial attempt.

backoff: Defines the backoff policy. We're using a delay of 1 second (delay = 1000 milliseconds), with a multiplier of 2 (the delay will increase with each retry).


@Recover:

This method is a fallback method that will be called if the retries are exhausted. It must have the same signature as the original method.



4. Test the Retryable Behavior

In a main class or controller, you can call the performNetworkCall method to test the retry functionality.

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class RetryApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(RetryApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        String result = myService.performNetworkCall();
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}

5. Output Example

You can expect the following outputs depending on the success or failure of the performNetworkCall method:

1. If it fails and then succeeds within the retry limit:

Simulating failure...
Simulating failure...
Network call succeeded.
Result: Success


2. If it fails for all retry attempts:

Simulating failure...
Simulating failure...
Simulating failure...
Retries exhausted. Recovering...
Result: Failed after retries



Conclusion

This approach allows you to use Spring Retry without explicitly creating a RetryTemplate. By using the @Retryable annotation, Spring handles retrying the method automatically, and you can configure it with simple annotations. Additionally, the @Recover annotation allows you to provide a fallback method if the retries are exhausted.
