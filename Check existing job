Yes, it is possible to check if there is an existing job running or completed before launching a new job in Spring Batch. Spring Batch uses its JobRepository to track job executions, and you can query this repository to determine the status of a particular job.

Steps to Check for Existing Job Instances

1. Use the JobExplorer

The JobExplorer provides access to job-related metadata, such as running job instances, job executions, and their statuses.

Example Implementation:

@Service
public class JobStatusChecker {

    @Autowired
    private JobExplorer jobExplorer;

    public boolean isJobRunning(String jobName) {
        // Get all running job executions for the given job name
        List<JobInstance> jobInstances = jobExplorer.getJobInstances(jobName, 0, 1);

        if (!jobInstances.isEmpty()) {
            for (JobInstance instance : jobInstances) {
                List<JobExecution> executions = jobExplorer.getJobExecutions(instance);
                for (JobExecution execution : executions) {
                    if (execution.getStatus().isRunning()) {
                        System.out.println("Job is currently running: " + execution.getId());
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Explanation:

1. Retrieve the JobInstance for the given job name.


2. Get all JobExecutions for the JobInstance.


3. Check if any execution is in a RUNNING status.

2. Use JobOperator

You can use the JobOperator to check if a job is currently running.

Example Implementation:

@Service
public class JobStatusChecker {

    @Autowired
    private JobOperator jobOperator;

    public boolean isJobRunning(String jobName) {
        // Get all running job executions
        Set<Long> runningJobExecutions = jobOperator.getRunningExecutions(jobName);

        if (!runningJobExecutions.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Found running job executions for job: " + jobName);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Explanation:

The JobOperator#getRunningExecutions() method returns a list of running execution IDs for the given job name.

3. Query the Spring Batch Tables

If you want to check directly in the database, you can query the Spring Batch metadata tables (BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION, BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE) to determine if a job is already running.

SQL Query:

SELECT JOB_INSTANCE_ID, JOB_NAME, STATUS
FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
WHERE JOB_NAME = 'your_job_name'
  AND STATUS = 'STARTED';

Replace 'your_job_name' with the name of the job.

Check the STATUS column for the STARTED or RUNNING state.



---

4. Prevent Duplicate Job Execution

If a job is already running, you can prevent the new job from starting by throwing an exception or skipping the job launch.

Example Integration with JobLauncher:

@Service
public class JobLauncherService {

    @Autowired
    private JobLauncher jobLauncher;

    @Autowired
    private JobStatusChecker jobStatusChecker;

    @Autowired
    private Job job;

    public void launchJob(JobParameters jobParameters) throws Exception {
        if (jobStatusChecker.isJobRunning(job.getName())) {
            System.err.println("Job is already running. Skipping launch.");
            return;
        }
        jobLauncher.run(job, jobParameters);
    }
}

Best Practices

1. Idempotent Job Names:

Use a unique JobParameters combination for each job instance to avoid conflicts.



2. Fail Early:

Check job status before launching a new job to prevent redundant execution.



3. Spring Batch Metadata Cleanup:

Periodically clean up Spring Batch metadata tables if old job executions are no longer relevant.





---

Scenarios

1. If a Job is Running:

The job will not be launched again.

Optionally, log a message or raise an alert.



2. If No Job is Running:

Launch the job as usual.

This solution ensures that only one instance of a job runs at a time and prevents duplicate or overlapping executions. Let me know if you need further assistance!
