The error in the image indicates a DataIntegrityViolationException caused by a data truncation while updating the BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT. Specifically, the serialized context being stored exceeds the maximum length of the column (SERIALIZED_CONTEXT) in the database.

This issue occurs because Spring Batch tries to persist the ExecutionContext (either JobExecutionContext or StepExecutionContext) into the database, but the size of the serialized data exceeds the column's limit.

Root Cause

1. Large Data in ExecutionContext:

If you store a large dataset (e.g., lists, maps, or other large objects) in the ExecutionContext, Spring Batch serializes it and attempts to store it in the BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT table. The default schema limits the SERIALIZED_CONTEXT column size.



2. Default Schema Constraint:

By default, Spring Batch creates the SERIALIZED_CONTEXT column as a TEXT or VARCHAR(255) type (depending on your database), which has limited capacity.

Solutions

1. Reduce the Size of the ExecutionContext

Avoid storing large datasets in the ExecutionContext. Instead:

Write large data (e.g., movie IDs or processing results) to a temporary database table or file system.

Store only references (e.g., file paths or database keys) in the ExecutionContext.



Example: Instead of storing a large list of IDs:

chunkContext.getStepContext()
    .getStepExecution()
    .getExecutionContext()
    .put("movieIds", largeList);

Store a reference (e.g., file path):

chunkContext.getStepContext()
    .getStepExecution()
    .getExecutionContext()
    .put("filePath", "/tmp/movie_ids.txt");


---

2. Increase the Size of the SERIALIZED_CONTEXT Column

If reducing the data size is not feasible, increase the column size in your database schema.

MySQL: Change the column type from TEXT to LONGTEXT:

ALTER TABLE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT MODIFY SERIALIZED_CONTEXT LONGTEXT;

PostgreSQL: Use the TEXT type, which supports large data:

ALTER TABLE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT ALTER COLUMN SERIALIZED_CONTEXT TYPE TEXT;

Oracle: Change the column to CLOB:

ALTER TABLE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT MODIFY SERIALIZED_CONTEXT CLOB;

3. Compress the Data

Compress the data before storing it in the ExecutionContext to reduce the serialized size. For example, use GZIP compression.


Example:

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream;

public byte[] compressObject(Object obj) throws Exception {
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    try (GZIPOutputStream gzipOutputStream = new GZIPOutputStream(byteArrayOutputStream);
         ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(gzipOutputStream)) {
        objectOutputStream.writeObject(obj);
    }
    return byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();
}

You can then decompress the data when reading it back.

4. Use an External Storage for Large Data

For extremely large datasets, avoid using the ExecutionContext altogether. Store the data in:

A database table and retrieve it in subsequent steps.

A file and store the file path in the ExecutionContext.




---

5. Monitor and Log ExecutionContext Size

To debug and avoid such issues in the future, log the size of the ExecutionContext before it is persisted.

Example:

System.out.println("ExecutionContext size: " + executionContext.toString().length());

Recommendation

If possible, reduce the size of data stored in the ExecutionContext. Use references (e.g., IDs, file paths) instead of storing the actual data. If the data must be stored, modify the database schema to accommodate larger serialized objects.
