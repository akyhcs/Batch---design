Yes, it is possible to fetch active (running) jobs without knowing the specific job name. Spring Batch's JobExplorer or JobOperator
can be used to retrieve all currently running job executions.

1. Fetch Active Jobs Using JobExplorer

The JobExplorer can fetch all running job executions regardless of their names. It provides a list of job execution metadata for analysis.

Example: Retrieve All Running Jobs

@Service
public class ActiveJobChecker {

    @Autowired
    private JobExplorer jobExplorer;

    public List<JobExecution> getActiveJobs() {
        List<JobExecution> activeJobs = new ArrayList<>();

        // Iterate through all job names known to JobExplorer
        for (String jobName : jobExplorer.getJobNames()) {
            // Get all running executions for this job
            Set<JobExecution> runningExecutions = jobExplorer.findRunningJobExecutions(jobName);
            activeJobs.addAll(runningExecutions);
        }

        return activeJobs;
    }
}

Explanation:

1. jobExplorer.getJobNames(): Retrieves all job names tracked in the metadata tables.


2. jobExplorer.findRunningJobExecutions(jobName): Retrieves all running job executions for a given job name.

2. Fetch Active Jobs Using JobOperator

The JobOperator can retrieve IDs of all running job executions across all job names.

Example: Retrieve Running Job IDs

@Service
public class ActiveJobChecker {

    @Autowired
    private JobOperator jobOperator;

    public Set<Long> getActiveJobExecutionIds() {
        // Fetch IDs of all running job executions
        return jobOperator.getRunningExecutions();
    }

    public List<JobExecution> getActiveJobExecutions() {
        Set<Long> runningExecutionIds = getActiveJobExecutionIds();
        List<JobExecution> activeExecutions = new ArrayList<>();

        for (Long executionId : runningExecutionIds) {
            JobExecution jobExecution = jobOperator.getJobExecution(executionId);
            activeExecutions.add(jobExecution);
        }

        return activeExecutions;
    }
}

Explanation:

1. jobOperator.getRunningExecutions(): Fetches IDs of all currently running job executions.


2. jobOperator.getJobExecution(executionId): Fetches metadata for each running job execution.

3. Query Spring Batch Metadata Tables

You can query the metadata tables directly to get a list of active jobs.

SQL Query:

SELECT JOB_EXECUTION_ID, JOB_NAME, STATUS
FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
WHERE STATUS = 'STARTED';

BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION: Contains metadata about job executions.

STATUS = 'STARTED': Indicates jobs that are currently running.



---

4. Monitor Active Jobs Dynamically

You can combine the above approaches to dynamically monitor all running jobs and their statuses.

Example: Monitor and Log Active Jobs

@Service
public class ActiveJobLogger {

    @Autowired
    private JobExplorer jobExplorer;

    public void logActiveJobs() {
        for (String jobName : jobExplorer.getJobNames()) {
            Set<JobExecution> runningExecutions = jobExplorer.findRunningJobExecutions(jobName);
            for (JobExecution jobExecution : runningExecutions) {
                System.out.println("Active Job:");
                System.out.println(" - Name: " + jobExecution.getJobInstance().getJobName());
                System.out.println(" - Execution ID: " + jobExecution.getId());
                System.out.println(" - Status: " + jobExecution.getStatus());
            }
        }
    }
}

Summary

Use JobExplorer:

Fetch all job names and running executions dynamically.


Use JobOperator:

Get execution IDs of all running jobs and their details.


Direct Query:

Query BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION metadata for running jobs.



These methods allow you to monitor active jobs without needing their names explicitly. Let me know if you'd like further help!
