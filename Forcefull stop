@Component
public class MyTasklet implements Tasklet {

    @Autowired
    private MyBusinessService businessService;

    @Override
    public RepeatStatus execute(StepContribution contribution, ChunkContext chunkContext) {
        JobExecution jobExecution = chunkContext.getStepContext().getStepExecution().getJobExecution();

        // If stop is requested, exit immediately
        if (jobExecution.isStopping() || Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            System.out.println("Job is stopping, exiting step...");
            return RepeatStatus.FINISHED;
        }

        try {
            businessService.processBusinessLogic();  // Call the business logic
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error executing business logic", e);
        }

        return RepeatStatus.FINISHED; // Tasklet runs only once
    }
}
Once the business logic (businessService.processBusinessLogic()) starts executing, the control flow will not return to the if condition at the top unless the business logic itself actively checks for stop signals.

ðŸ”¹ Why?

The if (jobExecution.isStopping() || Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) only checks the stop signal once before starting the business logic.

If the business logic runs for a long time (e.g., processing a large dataset or looping over records), it wonâ€™t stop until it completes naturally or throws an exception.

Solution: The business logic itself must periodically check for stop signals.

âœ… Solution: Modify Business Logic to Respect Stop Requests

Modify the processBusinessLogic() method in MyBusinessService to check for interruptions during execution.

ðŸ”¹ Example: Add Stop Check in Business Logic

@Service
public class MyBusinessService {

    public void processBusinessLogic() {
        System.out.println("Executing business logic...");

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  // Simulating work in iterations
            if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                System.out.println("Business logic interrupted, stopping execution...");
                return; // Gracefully exit
            }

            try {
                System.out.println("Processing batch " + (i + 1));
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate processing time
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();  // Preserve interrupt flag
                System.out.println("Business logic interrupted during sleep.");
                return;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Business logic completed.");
    }
}

ðŸ”¹ Why This Works

âœ” Periodically checks Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() inside a loop.
âœ” Stops execution immediately when an interrupt request is detected.
âœ” Handles InterruptedException properly to avoid ignoring the stop signal.


---

âœ… Alternative: Throw Exception on Interrupt

If you prefer to fail fast instead of returning, throw a custom exception.

public void processBusinessLogic() {
    System.out.println("Executing business logic...");

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            throw new JobInterruptedException("Business logic interrupted, stopping job.");
        }

        try {
            System.out.println("Processing batch " + (i + 1));
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw new JobInterruptedException("Business logic interrupted during sleep.", e);
        }
    }

    System.out.println("Business logic completed.");
}

ðŸ”¹ Effect:
âœ” Ensures the batch job fails immediately when stopped.
âœ” Spring Batch will catch JobInterruptedException and stop execution.

âœ… Summary: How to Ensure Stop Requests Work

ðŸš€ Final Answer

The control flow does not go back to if in Tasklet once businessService.processBusinessLogic() starts.

Solution: Modify processBusinessLogic() to periodically check Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted().

If the job is stopped, gracefully exit or throw an exception to ensure it doesnâ€™t continue running.
