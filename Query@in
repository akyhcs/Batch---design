Yes, you can use a @Query annotation in Spring Data JPA to fetch records based on a list of IDs 
in an Oracle database.
Since Oracle supports the IN clause, you can use it as follows:


---

1. Using @Query with IN Clause (Oracle)

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.query.Param;
import java.util.List;

public interface MyEntityRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long> {

    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM MY_ENTITY WHERE ID IN (:ids)", nativeQuery = true)
    List<MyEntity> findByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);
}

âœ… @Query is using a native SQL query (nativeQuery = true) for Oracle.
âœ… :ids dynamically replaces the list of IDs in the IN clause.


---

2. Using WHERE ID IN (:ids) with a List (JPA JPQL)

If you're using JPQL (instead of native SQL), you don't need nativeQuery = true:

@Query("SELECT m FROM MyEntity m WHERE m.id IN :ids")
List<MyEntity> findByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);

âœ… Uses JPA syntax (SELECT m FROM MyEntity m).
âœ… Works with Hibernate (without using native Oracle SQL).


---

3. Handling Large Lists (Oracle IN Clause Limitation)

Oracle limits the IN clause to 1000 elements. If your list is large:

Split the list into batches of 1000 and run multiple queries.

Use TEMPORARY TABLE or JOIN for large datasets.


Would you like an example to handle large lists dynamically? ðŸš€
