To check jobs and steps that still have an UNKNOWN status in the Spring Batch metadata tables, you can run the following SQL queries based on your database.


---

ðŸ”¹ Query to Check Jobs with UNKNOWN Status

SELECT JOB_INSTANCE_ID, JOB_EXECUTION_ID, JOB_NAME, STATUS, START_TIME, END_TIME
FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
WHERE STATUS = 'UNKNOWN';

âœ… Finds jobs that are stuck in UNKNOWN status
âœ… Shows job name, start time, and end time for investigation


---

ðŸ”¹ Query to Check Steps with UNKNOWN Status

SELECT STEP_EXECUTION_ID, JOB_EXECUTION_ID, STEP_NAME, STATUS, START_TIME, END_TIME
FROM BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION
WHERE STATUS = 'UNKNOWN';

âœ… Finds steps that are still UNKNOWN
âœ… Links each step to its corresponding job execution


---

ðŸ”¹ Query to Find UNKNOWN Jobs and Their Steps

SELECT 
    j.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, j.JOB_NAME, j.STATUS AS JOB_STATUS, 
    s.STEP_NAME, s.STATUS AS STEP_STATUS, j.START_TIME, j.END_TIME
FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION j
JOIN BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION s ON j.JOB_EXECUTION_ID = s.JOB_EXECUTION_ID
WHERE j.STATUS = 'UNKNOWN' OR s.STATUS = 'UNKNOWN';

âœ… Finds all jobs and steps that are UNKNOWN in one query.
âœ… Shows the job and step details together.


---

ðŸ”¹ Query to Get Latest Job Runs (Debugging)

If you want to check the last executed jobs, use:

SELECT JOB_EXECUTION_ID, JOB_NAME, STATUS, START_TIME, END_TIME
FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC
LIMIT 5;

âœ… Lists the last 5 executed jobs to track failures.


---

ðŸ”¹ If You Want to Fix It Manually

If you find UNKNOWN jobs and want to mark them as FAILED manually, use:

UPDATE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
SET STATUS = 'FAILED'
WHERE STATUS = 'UNKNOWN';

And for steps:

UPDATE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION
SET STATUS = 'FAILED'
WHERE STATUS = 'UNKNOWN';

âœ… Ensures UNKNOWN jobs and steps don't block new executions.

ðŸ“Œ Summary

Would you like an automated Spring Batch script to clean up UNKNOWN statuses before job execution? ðŸš€
