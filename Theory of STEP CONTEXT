Yes, it is possible to encounter a NullPointerException in the second tasklet even after setting the ExecutionContext in the first tasklet. This can happen due to:


---

1. Incorrect Access to ExecutionContext

If ExecutionContext is modified or accessed incorrectly, the data might not persist between tasklets.

Example Issue:

The key name used to set data in the first tasklet ("movieIds") doesn’t match the key used to retrieve it in the second tasklet.

A mismatch will result in null when attempting to fetch the data.


Solution:

Always use consistent and descriptive key names for storing and retrieving data.




---

2. Step Execution Context Isolation

Each step in Spring Batch has its own ExecutionContext. If you set data in the ExecutionContext of Step 1, it won’t automatically be available in Step 2 unless the ExecutionContext is part of the JobExecutionContext.

Default Behavior:

The StepExecutionContext is step-specific, while the JobExecutionContext is shared across all steps of a job.


Solution:

Use the JobExecutionContext for data that needs to be shared between steps:

chunkContext.getStepContext()
    .getStepExecution()
    .getJobExecution()
    .getExecutionContext()
    .put("movieIds", movieIds);

In the second tasklet, fetch the data from the JobExecutionContext:

List<String> movieIds = (List<String>) chunkContext.getStepContext()
    .getStepExecution()
    .getJobExecution()
    .getExecutionContext()
    .get("movieIds");




---

3. Serialization and Persistence Issues

If the ExecutionContext is being persisted to a database (e.g., in the JobRepository), serialization issues can cause the data not to persist properly.

Example:

The object being stored (movieIds list) is not serializable.


Solution:

Ensure that all objects stored in the ExecutionContext implement Serializable if required:

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;




---

4. Concurrency or Timing Issues

If Tasklet 2 starts before Tasklet 1 finishes (e.g., due to misconfiguration or incorrect job flow setup), the ExecutionContext may not yet contain the data.

Solution:

Ensure proper step ordering in the job:

jobBuilderFactory.get("movieJob")
    .start(step1)
    .next(step2)
    .build();


Use a JobExecutionListener to verify that Tasklet 1 has successfully completed:

@Override
public void afterStep(StepExecution stepExecution) {
    if (stepExecution.getExitStatus().equals(ExitStatus.COMPLETED)) {
        System.out.println("Step 1 completed successfully.");
    }
}



---

5. Null Checks and Defaults

Even with proper setup, unexpected issues (e.g., database connectivity, misconfiguration) can cause data to be missing. Adding null checks and default behaviors is essential.

Example Code with Null Check:

@Override
public RepeatStatus execute(StepContribution contribution, ChunkContext chunkContext) throws Exception {
    List<String> movieIds = (List<String>) chunkContext.getStepContext()
        .getStepExecution()
        .getJobExecution()
        .getExecutionContext()
        .get("movieIds");

    if (movieIds == null || movieIds.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No movie IDs found in the ExecutionContext!");
    }

    for (String movieId : movieIds) {
        System.out.println("Processing " + movieId);
    }
    return RepeatStatus.FINISHED;
}

Best Practices

1. Use JobExecutionContext: For sharing data across steps, always prefer the JobExecutionContext over the StepExecutionContext.


2. Add Null and Empty Checks: Validate the presence of data before processing it.


3. Verify Step Completion: Use listeners to ensure Tasklet 1 finishes before Tasklet 2 starts.


4. Debug with Logs: Add logging in Tasklet 1 and Tasklet 2 to confirm the data is being stored and retrieved correctly.
